\arguments{
\item{query}{GRanges Set of GRanges to query. Refer to gr.findoverlaps() and GenomicRanges::findOverlaps()}

\item{subject}{GRanges Set of GRanges as 'subject' in query. Refer to  gr.findoverlaps() and GenomicRanges::findOverlaps()}

\item{by}{vector Additional metadata fields to join on}

\item{all}{boolean Flag whether to include left and right joins}

\item{all.query}{boolean Flag whether to do a left join (default = all)}

\item{all.subject}{boolean Flag whether to do a right join (default = all)}

\item{ignore.strand}{boolean Strand information ignored (default = TRUE)}

\item{verbose}{boolean}
}
\value{
GRanges merged on 'by' vector
}
\description{
Uses gr.findoverlaps() to enable internal and external joins of GRanges using
syntax similar to "merge" where merging is done using coordinates +/- "by" fields

Uses gr.findoverlaps() / GRanges::findOverlaps for heavy lifting, but returns outputs with
metadata populated as well as query and subject ids.  For external joins,
overlaps x with gaps(y) and gaps(x) with y.
