\usage{
ra.overlaps(ra1, ra2, pad = 0, arr.ind = TRUE, ignore.strand = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{ra1}{\code{GRangesList} with rearrangement set 1}

\item{ra2}{\code{GRangesList} with rearrangement set 2}

\item{pad}{Amount to pad the overlaps by. Larger is more permissive. Default is exact (0)}

\item{arr.ind}{Default TRUE}

\item{ignore.strand}{Ignore rearrangement orientation when doing overlaps. Default FALSE}

\item{...}{params to be sent to \code{\link{gr.findoverlaps}}}
}
\description{
Determines overlaps between two piles of rearrangement junctions ra1 and ra2 (each GRangesLists of signed locus pairs)
against each other, returning a sparseMatrix that is T at entry ij if junction i overlaps junction j.

if argument pad = 0 (default) then only perfect overlap will validate, otherwise if pad>0 is given, then
padded overlap is allowed

strand matters, though we test overlap of both ra1[i] vs ra2[j] and gr.flipstrand(ra2[j])
